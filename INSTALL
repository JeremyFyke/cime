This file contains information about building and installing GPTL. For
information on using the library, see the file README.

After untarring the distribution and then doing "cd gptl", construct a
macros.make file by editing one of the templates provided (currenty there's
macros.make.linux, and macros.make.sicortex) that is closest to the machine
you're building the library on. Step-by-step instructions for setting each
configuration option are embedded in that file. If unsure of some settings,
you can run "./suggestions". This is an autoconf "configure" script which has
been modified to just print suggestions, rather than creating any output
files. After creating macros.make:

% make all
% make test
% make install

The "make test" step runs some of the example codes in ctests/ and ftests/
and checks the results.
