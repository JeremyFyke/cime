This file describes how to build and install GPTL. For information on using
the library, see the web pages in the doc/ directory, and the file README in
the main directory. 

After untarring the distribution, construct a macros.make file by editing one
of the templates provided that is closest to the machine you're building the
library on. Currenty available template files are macros.make.linux,
macros.make.intel, and macros.make.AIX. Step-by-step instructions for setting
each configuration option are embedded in that file. If unsure of some
settings, you can run "./suggestions". This is an autoconf "configure" script
which has been modified to just print suggestions, rather than creating any
output files.

It is a good idea to build with FORTRAN=yes even if you're not going to use
the Fortran wrappers. The reason is that "make test" will do more
thorough testing of the library via the Fortran tests.

After creating macros.make:

% make
% make test
% make install

The "make test" step runs some of the example codes in ctests/ and ftests/
and checks the results.
