.TH GPTLpr_summary 3 "March, 2009" "GPTL"

.SH NAME
GPTLpr_summary \- Print a counter summary across all threads and tasks

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B C Interface:
.nf
int GPTLpr_summary (MPI_Comm comm);
.fi

.B Fortran Interface:
.nf
integer gptlpr_summary (integer comm)
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
This routine is both experimental and deprecated. Suggest using
post-processing script
.B parsegptlout.pl
instead. GPTLpr_summary() summarizes stats across all threads and tasks to a file named 
.B timing.summary. It is only available if GPTL was built with MPI enabled. Only
regions which exist for thread 0, task 0 are considered.

.SH ARGUMENTS
.I comm
-- MPI communicator to sum across. An input of 0 means use MPI_COMM_WORLD

.SH RESTRICTIONS
.B GPTLinitialize()
must have been called. Must be between calls to
.B MPI_Initialize()
and
.B MPI_Finalize()


.SH RETURN VALUES
On success, this function returns 0.
On error, a negative error code is returned and a descriptive message
printed. 

.SH EXAMPLE OUTPUT
None yet provided.

.SH BUGS
Only regions in task 0, thread 0 are checked. No indentation is
performed. Building GPTL with MPI enabled means all executables
linked with GPTL will require linking with the MPI library as well.
This could be fixed by building GPTL as a shared library.
