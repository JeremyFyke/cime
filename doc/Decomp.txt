 */ /*! \page decomp Describing decompositions


One of the biggest challenges to working with PIO is setting up 
the call to \ref PIO_initdecomp.  The user must properly describe
how the data within each MPI tasks memory should be placed or retrieved from 
disk. PIO provides two methods to rearrange data from compute tasks to IO tasks.  
The first method, called box rearrangement is the only one provided in PIO1.   
The second called subset rearrangement is introduced in PIO2.  

\section BOXREARR Box rearrangement

In this method data is rearranged from compute to IO tasks such that
the arrangement of data on the IO tasks optimizes the call from the IO
tasks to the underlying (NetCDF) IO library.  In this case each
compute task will transfer data to one or more IO tasks.





\section SUBSETREARR Subset rearrangement

In this method each IO task is associated with a unique subset of
compute tasks so that each compute task will transfer data to one and
only one IO task.  Since this technique does not guarantee that data
on the IO node represents a contiguous block of data on the file it
may require multiple calls to the underlying (NetCDF) IO library.

As an example suppose we have a global two dimensional grid of size 4x5 decomposed over 5 tasks. We represent the 
two dimensional grid in terms of offset from the initial element ie
<pre>
     0  1  2  3 
     4  5  6  7 
     8  9 10 11
    12 13 14 15
    16 17 18 19 
</pre>
Now suppose this data is distributed over the compute tasks as follows:
<pre>
0: {   0  1  2  3  } 
1: {   4  5  6  7  } 
2: {   8  9 10 11  } 
3: {  12 13 14 15  } 
4: {  16 17 18 19  } 
</pre>
Then the argument to
