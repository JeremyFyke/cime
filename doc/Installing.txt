 */ /*! \page install Installing PIO

<ol>
<li>Download the code from the following Google code subversion location using either a subversion export:

> svn export http://parallelio.googlecode.com/svn/trunk_tags/pio1_8_12  <<<< need to correct
</li>

<li>PIO uses <a href="http://www.cmake.org> cmake </a> to configure and build 

Before running cmake, you will need to know the location of some supporting libraries. 

- Set the NETCDF_DIR environment variable to the netcdf install directory.

- Set the PNETCDF_DIR environment variable to the pnetcdf install directory, This will enable support
for parallel-netcdf

- Set the CC, FC, MPICC, and MPIFC environment variables to the serial and parallel C and Fortran 90 compiler names.

This should be the minimal set of flags required to build pio.

One additional flag of interest is -PIO_FILESYSTEM_HINTS which can
be set to gpfs or lustre.  You should only use this flag if you are sure that the
file system you are using is either gpfs or lustre respectively. If you are unsure, then do not use this flag. </li>

<li>After cmake completes use gmake in the build directory to complete the build.   

> gmake

Note that although the user application only needs to 'use pio'  at least some compilers require that
all of the module files be located in the install directory. If that is the case, then running

> gmake install 

will move the compiled library and module files to the directory specified by $PREFIX.</li>
</ol>
