gptl1_4: - Added NUMERIC_TIMERS (configure --enable-numeric) for speedup.
	 If enabled, user args to start/stop MUST be numeric tags rather
	 than character strings.  Intended primarily to be used with
	 automatic code instrumentation (g++ -finstrument-functions), 
	 and tests/jr-resolve.pl to back out a name.
	 - Added "numeric" to tests/ in order to test --enable-numeric.
	 - Remove HASH as an option (it is now assumed) for readability.
	 - Moved some OMP code from threadutil.c to gptl.c strictly for
	 efficiency (inlining).  Hated to do it because the code really
	 doesn't belong there.
	 - Added jr-resolve.pl to tests/ to back out symbol name from
	 address. 
gpt1_2: Changed GPT to GPTL to avoid overlap with other utilities named GPT...
gpt1_1: Added README and man pages.  Better commenting.  Fixed bug in min
        calcs in GPTstop.
gpt1_0: Added PAPI support.  For whatever reason, on IBM get negative
	increments occasionally.
gpt0_3: Added overflow diagnostic novfl
	Migrate threading ops to threadutil.c
	Remove useless calcs from GPTstop
	Added iteration option to depth test
	overhead test is now a C code and tests potentially expensive
          calcs embedded in the library
	Removed exp, expensive, timetimeing tests
	Reenabled pthreads
	Fix SGI complaints about arg lists
	Changed depth array to mitigate false sharing
	Added DISABLE_TIMERS ifdef
	autoconf bugfix
	Change microsecond accumulator test from 1000000 to 10000000
gpt0_2: Remove unused components in Timer. Make "name" component a fixed
        size for efficiency.
gpt0_1: Add hashtable for efficiency. Add some more tests.  Add ChangeLog.
	Bugfix for printing.
